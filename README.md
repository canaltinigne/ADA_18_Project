# Analysis and Impacts of Fake News

# Abstract
Everybody lies at some point of time. However, if the liar is a popular and respected source or figure in society, this may have crucial effects on people. The goal of this project is to analyze the distribution of lies among the political figures and news sources in the U.S. and the effects of these lies on voters and social media. We use Liar dataset collected from PolitiFact.com and prepared by William Yang Wang. We aim to specify the topics which politicians and news sources mostly lie about. Also, we intend to reveal if the lies told by politicians propagate to other news sources. We would like to emphasize the power of the statements made by notable sources in society. Because, we believe that the manipulation of people's decisions through fake news may have drastic effects on society and democracy in a country. As we are all from Turkey, we are the witnesses of how biased media manipulates the people's political views which determine the future of the country.
